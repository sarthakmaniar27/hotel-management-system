# Tech Stack: 
Frondend: Html, CSS, JavaScript 
Backend: php
Database: MySql (phpmyadmin)

Aim of this project:
Created an application for ease of use for Hotel Management <br />
Through this project, we are trying to develop an all-purpose user-friendly software that can be used by the Hotel for maintenance and updation of records. <br />

# Introduction: 
-Traditionally, all databases maintained by any hotel were on paperback. This posed various challenges such as: <br />
Keeping manual track records of all systems simultaneously generates a huge error margin. <br /> 
Data recovery is extremely difficult since backups for paperback systems are difficult to maintain
Manpower, which can be better utilized elsewhere, is wasted on maintaining records. <br />
Sorting, searching and retrieving data requires tremendous effort. <br />
Communication between departments cannot be handled efficiently. <br />
Through our application, we will overcome all above disadvantages, while also adding certain functionalities for further use. The following reasons highlight the need of a DBMS for managing a hotel: -
Generating Backups for referencing data and keeping all important data safe. <br />
Login Systems with password Encryption so that data can be encapsulated. The degree of information available can be tuned from user to user (multi-level security)
Extremely quick updation, deletion and retrieval of data. <br />
Data maintained will be consistent and integrated. Redundant data will be effectively removed. <br />
Overall database will have a simple structure and user-friendly UI to interact with it. <br />
Apart from records, daily work schedules of Staff members can be updated which eases communication. <br />

# Overview of the system
We have developed the application to function in the following manner:

#### Display Page will be a login/sign up system. Here an individual user can create or access his account with a unique username and password. Individual users can login as Managers, Staff Members or Clients (Customers).  <br />
#### There will be a single account with access to all Information in the Database. The corresponding account holder will be the authority owning the hotel.  <br />
#### Managers will be able to access varied information. Records pertaining to Staff members, room bookings, transactions and client demands will be accessible at this level.  <br />
#### Staff Members will be able to view data regarding their work schedules. They will also have access to records pertaining to room status and demands/grievances of customers.  <br />
#### Customers will be able to sign up and view the availability status of each individual room. They will be able to thereby process transactions and continue with booking rooms as required. Moreover, they will be able to lodge their demands and complaints (if any) into the system for the hotel authorities to act upon.  <br />
